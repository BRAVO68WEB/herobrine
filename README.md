# Herobrine

A rewrite of [Steve](https://github.com/greysdawn/steve).

---

**Herobrine** is a semi-temporary Discord bot that serves as a test run for redone/new code.
When he's done, he'll be used repurposed for a private D&D-style RP server we own, but others are free to use him at that point! This repo mainly servers as a place to keep all his code during the rewrite.

This version of Herobrine is made using the [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris) framework, and utilizes [dblite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dblite) for local databases. If you plan to run him on your own machine, he'll need a config file that looks something like this:

```
{

"token" : "biglongthingfromdiscord",

"prefix" : ["hh!","heyhero ","heyherobrine "],
"accepted_ids" : ["yourdiscordidhere"],
"sqlite": "./path/to/sqlite/executable.exe"

}

```

The prefix can be just one word, but it'll take tweaking the code unless you keep it in the array.

`token`: The token from the Discord bot you have registered on your account [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).    
`prefix`: The prefix(es) you want Herobrine to respond to.    
`accepted_ids`: Your/the bot owner's ID. Made to accept multiple in case of multiple accounts.    
`sqlite`: The path to your sqlite3 executable. Fixes "kill einvalid" errors on Windows, may not be needed for other platforms.
