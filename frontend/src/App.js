          <h3><em>A <span className="App-color">multi-purpose</span> bot for Discord</em></h3>
          <p><strong>Herobrine</strong> is a Discord bot created by <a href="https://github.com/greysdawn">@greysdawn</a>{" "}
            and inspired by bots like Tatsumaki. He can be used for custom colors, welcome messages, [hack]banning, self-roles, and more.{" "}
            His default prefix is <em>hh!</em>, but servers can set their own using the prefix command.<br/>Right now, Herobrine is only{" "}
            available to a handful of servers, as he's still an active work in progess.

        <p>This website is still a work in progress - check back later for more in-depth info on the commands! We're also working on a dashboard to make server management easier</p>
        <p><strong>Prefix:</strong> Herobrine's prefix is hh!</p>
        <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> The permissions that Herobrine needs are Manage Messages (for pruning),{" "}
                   Manage Roles (for creating, editing, etc roles), Send Messages (obviously), Embed Links (for the color embeds),{" "}
                   and Ban Members (speaks for itself). Giving him admin permissions may be the easiest way to go.

            Currently, Herobrine is being run on a Vultr VPS along with a few other bots and the rest of our sites. At the moment this means that{" "}
            he only has 2gb of RAM to share with everything else, and we will eventually need an upgraded{" "}
            environment to run in. We're also without a job right now, and rely on patrons and donations to get by.<br/>
            If you'd like to donate, you can send money to our Ko-Fi or choose to become a Patron.
